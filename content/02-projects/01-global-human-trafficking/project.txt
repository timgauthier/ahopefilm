title: Project: Where the People are

##Who we are
A [hope] film is a project focused on producing documentary films that inspire change and motivate action on social justice issues. Each film serves to bring education and awareness about the topic, then act as a platform to organize and step into action. Each film website will contain more information on the subject matter, as well as next steps to become involved locally and internationally. 


##The Goal

Each Film has a dedicated team behind it that drives the creative process, however each [hope] film project is united by a common set of goals;

* To Educate - go beyond awareness, and to bring knowledge and understanding to people.
* To Motivate - people to become active and involved, to do more then bring awareness, to become involved.
* To Inspire - ideas and projects that can make a difference, from a small initiative in your home town, to a global movement.
* To Support - as a platform for the topic. As a platform we will be able to bring financial support (through our 90/10 split of revenue), as well as being a focal point for information and organization.
* To Value - the voice that we have, by holding ourselves to the highest standards in production. A high-quality production lends credibility and reaches a bigger audience.

###Specific Goals

This film also has some specific goals in regards to the topic of human trafficking.

* to help people realise the global scope of the issue of human trafficking, and the local impact that it has in their communities
* To be a voice for the victims of global human trafficking by showing the true brutal and often violent situations that surround this issue.
* To not limit to a specific audience, this film is for Religious and non-religious people alike. We wish to have as broad an audience as possible, however we realize that the contents of our film will likely require a more mature rating.
* Our goal is to go through a complete emotional arc with our audience. By going deeper into the darker and more painful aspects of this topic we can go make the reality of this issue come alive in peoples minds. However it is important to then finish the film in a state of hope, by showing a realistic and concrete way to do something about this issue.


##Ethical

This [hope] film, like all of our projects, is held to a high ethical standard of personal integrity and crediblity. We seek to research this issue thoroughly so that we may present a factually accurate picture of the issue of global human trafficking.

##Get Involved

One of the goals for a [hope] film is to become a movement, leading people into action instead of just talking about a project. There are lots of ways to get involved, even before the film is finished!

###Research

Films need research, lots of research, infact we are expecting to spend more time doing research then shooting the film. The greatest thing a documentary can do to make sure it is at the highest quality is to spend more time in research.

We are also dealing with a difficult topic, not much research has been done into the actual numbers of people involved, and lots of the information used today is old or poorly sourced. We feel responsible to use information that we have been able to verify and to have an accurate picture.

You can get involved in our research as well, send any information or articles you find to <a href="mailto:&#114;&#101;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#102;&#105;&#108;&#109;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;?subject=Community Research:">&#114;&#101;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#114;&#99;&#104;&#64;&#97;&#104;&#111;&#112;&#101;&#102;&#105;&#108;&#109;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>

If you are interested in more direct assistance in research, you can also send us an email.

###Small Groups

Something we have seen that makes a huge impact in the fight against human trafficking is by starting small groups. Our friends at a Voice for the Voiceless are producing a great guide that leads you through the process of starting a small group who reach out specifically to sex trafficking victims.

You can easily start a group yourself though, simply ask around and see if there are other people in your community that are aware of the topic and interested in discussing it. Meet once a month or once a week. Maybe you start a research group, or bring sweets to prostitutes, or your own film!

###Organizations

There are many great organizations that are already combatting human trafficking, one great organization that you may wish to get involved with is <a href="http://www.stopthetraffik.org">Stop the Traffik</a>. Check out their website for ways to get invovled with them today.

###Support

Films are expensive, and we are doing this as non-profit volunteers. For some of us this is actually our job, but a [hope] film does not pay a salary. Everyone who works with us is supported by people who believe in what they are doing.

A [hope] film is primarily funded through people partnering with us in our projects. You can become a partner by visiting our indiegogo campaign [now](http://igg.me/at/ahopefilm)
