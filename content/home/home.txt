<p>Hope Films are short form documentaries showcasing people and projects working to combat injustice in the world. By focusing on the positive of what can be done, Hope Films serve to inspire a change. Instead of playing on peoples emotions and attempting to motivate through guilt, we focus on what is already being done. Hope Films inspire and challenge people through a positive  message.</p>			
			
<p>Each Hope Film project is focused on a specific topic of injustice. Hope Films start by showing us the raw and sometimes brutal reality of the issue, then introduce us to a person or project that is currently working towards a solution. We can see the contrast, and the daily work of what it takes to combat these injustices. Showing us that despite how impossible a situation may look, we can still do something that brings about a change. We believe even small actions are important and lead to large scale change.</p>			

<p>We feel film is a powerful story telling tool that can inspire action and motivate change. We believe that good stories are deeply engaging and truthful in nature. Hope Films are produced with journalistic integrity, striving to verify information and uphold the truth. We do however feel that it is important to share the viewpoints and opinions of our subjects and therefore will do very little to censor our content.</p>

<h3>How is it possible</h3>

<p>Every [hope] film serves not only as a form of entertainment or media awareness, but also as a way to bring financial support for the projects or people that we feature. Our films follow a 90/10 percentage split for revenue. 90% of the proceeds go towards supporting the people actually seen in the film, with only 10% being used to continue the production of more Hope Films.</p>
